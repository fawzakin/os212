# My Programs
These are programs which I either create, fork from other project, or help for development and worth the mention here.

[SIDOST](https://gitlab.com/fawzakin/sidost)  
My simple and efficient bash script to bootstrap my desktop to any fresh install of Arch in similar vein with Luke Smith's [LARBS](https://larbs.xyz).

[Easy Arch](https://gitlab.com/fawzakin/easy-arch)  
Quickly install Arch Linux with easy-to-understand script. Forked from Tommaso Chiti's [easy arch](https://github.com/classy-giraffe/easy-arch).

[dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/fawzakin/dotfiles)  
My dotfiles repository. Configurations for many linux programs that I use. Requires GNU `stow`.

[dwm](https://gitlab.com/fawzakin/dwm)  
My build of dwm (my main desktop/window manager). Now with the bar inspired from siduck76's [chadwm](https://github.com/siduck76/chadwm).

[dmscripts](https://gitlab.com/fawzakin/dmscripts)  
A collection of dmenu scripts that I have found useful in my day-to-day activities as a desktop Linux user. Forked from Derek "[DistroTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/DistroTube)" Taylor's [dmscripts](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dmscripts) which I contribute to. 

Here are the scripts I made for it:
- dm-note (available in the upstream)
- dm-command (coming soon)
- dm-pass (fork exclusive)
